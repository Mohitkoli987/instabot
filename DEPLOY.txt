🎯 MY RECOMMENDATION: USE RENDER
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Render is the EASIEST and most reliable for your app because:

✅ 750 hours/month free (always on)
✅ Perfect for Flask apps

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📋 PRE-DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Before deploying, make sure you have:

✅ Procfile (created - contains: web: gunicorn app:app)
✅ requirements.txt (updated with versions)
✅ runtime.txt (specifies Python version)
✅ app.py (configured for production)
✅ home.html (your only HTML file)

All set! ✅

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. FILE STORAGE:
   Free hosting platforms have temporary storage
   Downloaded videos will be deleted on restart
   Solution: Use Google Drive integration (already built-in!)

2. YOUTUBE API:
   Upload your client_secret.json to hosting platform
   Set as environment variable or secret file

3. INSTAGRAM LOGIN:
   Currently hardcoded in app.py
   Consider using environment variables for security

4. FFmpeg/yt-dlp:
   Some platforms may not have yt-dlp pre-installed
   Add to requirements.txt (already done ✅)
